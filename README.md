![Image of MZButtons](https://github.com/Yury-MonZon/MZButtons/blob/master/Photos/IMG_20180505_092451.jpg)
It has standard USB joystick interface with up to 128 buttons, 2 encoders, 4 switches. 
All done with the cheap stuff from Chinese shopping sites. 
Based on Pro Micro, with the 3D printable modular case - you can add more modules later.

# Status
The project is almost finished, check what's left below. The rest of the code and 3d printed case parts were printed/tested/debugged.
**TODO:**
Install encoders and debug the corresponding code. I'm still waiting for the parcel with encoders to arrive.

# Files and Folders
In **Decals** folder you can find **Print_me.html** file in which you can easily create and customize your own labels for the buttons. Just print it on any laser printer and cut the labels.
**STL files** are here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2836442

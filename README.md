Has a standard USB joystick interface with up to 128 buttons, 2 encoders, 4 switches.  
All done with inexpensive parts, easily obtainable at Chinese online shops.  
Based on Pro Micro, with the 3D printable expandable modular case.  

# Max number of buttons
The device can provide up to 128 buttons. Each rocker/toggle switch counts as 2 buttons, each encoder counts as 3 button. So the formula is:  
`#if ((KEYPADS_NO*16)+(ENCODERS_NO*3)+(SWITCHES_NO*2) > 128)
#error MAX allowed joystick buttons is 128!
#endif`  

# Suggestions wanted
Yup, I need someone to help me find the best layout for the decals and to add color-code grouping to them.  

# Status
The project is almost finished, check what's left below. The code and 3d printed case parts were printed/tested/debugged.  
**TODO:**
Install encoders and debug the corresponding code. I'm still waiting for the parcel with encoders to arrive.

# Files and Folders
In **Decals** folder you can find **Print_me.html** file in which you can easily create and customize your own labels for the buttons. Just print it out on any laser printer and cut along the lines.

# Schematics
There is no schematics as this project is very simple to assemble even if your soldering kung fu is not strong.  

- 16 buttons matrices  
are connected to A0, A1, A2, A3, 4, 6, 8, 9 pins on Arduino Pro Micro. Also, they use VCC and GND pins which could be chained from one module to another.  
- Rocker/Toggle switches  
should be connected to pins 10, 14, 15, 16 with the other wire connected to the GND pin.  
- Encoders  
The encoder's support has not been tested as I am still waiting for the parcel to arrive.
